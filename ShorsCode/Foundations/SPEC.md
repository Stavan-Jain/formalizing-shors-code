# SPEC.md — Formalizing the Quantum 3-Bit Repetition Code in Lean

##  Project Overview

**Goal:**  
To formally define and verify the **quantum 3-bit repetition code** in Lean 4.  
The final theorem will state that this code can **correct a single bit-flip (Pauli-X) error** on any of its three physical qubits.

**End Theorem (informal):**
> For any qubit state `ψ`, and for any single-qubit bit-flip error `Xᵢ`,  
> applying encoding → error → decoding yields the original state:
>
> ```
> ∀ ψ : Qubit, ∀ i : Fin 3, decode (Xᵢ (encode ψ)) = ψ
> ```

## Roadmap to the 3-Bit Code

### 1. `Quantum.Tensor`
- [ ] Define `tensorVec : Vector (2^n) → Vector (2^m) → Vector (2^(n+m))`
- [ ] Prove `norm (tensorVec ψ φ) = norm ψ * norm φ`
- [ ] Define `tensorState (ψ : QuantumState n) (φ : QuantumState m) : QuantumState (n + m)`
- [ ] Define shorthand operator `⊗` for readability

### 2. `Quantum.Gates`
- [ ] Prove that QuantumGate is a group under multiplication
  - [ ] Prove that QuantumGates are invertible
  - [ ] Prove that that the identity matrix is the group identity
- [ ] Prove that unitary matrices preserve norms

### 3. `Quantum.Code.Repetition3`
- [ ] Define the encoding map:  
  `encode : Qubit → QuantumState 3`,  
  where `encode |0⟩ = |000⟩` and `encode |1⟩ = |111⟩`
- [ ] Define bit-flip error operators `X₀, X₁, X₂`
- [ ] Define decoding operation `decode : QuantumState 3 → Qubit`
- [ ] Show `decode (encode ψ) = ψ`

### 4. `Quantum.Code.Theorems`
- [ ] Prove `decode (Xᵢ (encode ψ)) = ψ` for all single-bit flips
- [ ] Combine lemmas into `repetition3_corrects_single_bit_flip`

---

## Future Extensions

- [ ] Extend to **phase-flip code** (Z errors)  
- [ ] Compose both into **Shor’s 9-qubit code**
